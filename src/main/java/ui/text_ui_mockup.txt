run [output_file_name=out] [group_size=0]
    Run the current dataset with the network in use.

    The output is saved in a `.csv` file with the name as the first argument.

    The second argument may be used to separate groups of elements of the dataset
    into smaller test cases so that they don't interfere with each other during
    execution.
